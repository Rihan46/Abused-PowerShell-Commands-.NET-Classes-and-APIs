# Abused-PowerShell-Commands-.NET-Classes-and-APIs

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this repository is to catalog and document a comprehensive list of PowerShell commands, .NET classes, and system APIs that are commonly exploited by attackers. This resource aims to help cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, and threat researchers better understand and recognize potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing their defensive strategies against malicious activities.

## **Scope of the Report**
The scope of this Repo is to cover the below topics.

**Abused PowerShell Commands**: Commonly used PowerShell cmdlets and functions that are frequently exploited by attackers for malicious purposes. These commands can facilitate a range of activities, from downloading and executing malware to manipulating system processes and exfiltrating data.
**e.g**: Invoke-WebRequest, Invoke-Expression, Start-Process etc

**Exploited .NET Classes**: .NET classes that are often misused to perform unauthorized or harmful actions. These classes provide methods and properties that can be leveraged for various attack techniques, including but not limited to memory manipulation, process creation, and cryptographic operations.
**e.g**: System.Net.WebClient, System.Diagnostics.Process etc

**Misused System API**s: Low-level Windows API functions that attackers exploit to interact with system components. These APIs can be used for activities such as injecting code into processes, bypassing security controls, and performing stealthy operations.
**e.g**: VirtualAlloc, CreateRemoteThread, WriteProcessMemory etc
